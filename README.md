# ScrapyYahooFinance
Web Scraping project for most active stocks. In this project, I created a Scrapy spider to load the Yahoo finance page for most active daily stocks, load each stock and scrape the data from the stock summary page. The spicer also crawls across the pagination of the stocks.

For a tutorial on this project, kindly read the following articles:
